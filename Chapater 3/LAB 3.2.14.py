"""Your task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have, and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be
built using these blocks.

Note: the height is measured by the number of fully completed layers â€“ if the builders don't have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot
complete the next layer, they finish their work immediately."""

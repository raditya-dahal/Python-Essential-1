"""Your task here is even more special than before: you must redesign the (ugly) vowel eater from the previous lab and create a better,
upgraded (pretty) vowel eater! Write a program that uses:

a for loop;
the concept of conditional execution (if-elif-else)
the continue statement.
Your program must:

ask the user to enter a word;
use user_word = user_word.upper() to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; we'll talk about string methods and the upper()
method very soon - don't worry; use conditional execution and the continue statement to "eat" the following vowels A, E, I, O, U from the
inputted word; assign the uneaten letters to the word_without_vowels variable and print the variable to the screen.
Look at the code in the editor. We've created word_without_vowels and assigned an empty string to it. Use concatenation operation to ask
Python to combine selected letters into a longer string during subsequent loop turns, and assign it to the word_without_vowels variable."""

word_without_vowels = ""
user_word = input("Enter a word: ")
user_word = user_word.upper()

for letter in user_word:
    if letter in "AEIOU":
        continue
    else:
        word_without_vowels += letter
print(word_without_vowels)
